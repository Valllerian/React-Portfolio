# My React Portfolio

## Description

This is Valerii Bihuns Portfolio built in React! 
A programmer portfolio is more than a simple resume - it showcases and proves that you can do what is mentioned in the resume.

This project is going to be the base of my future portfolio and will be improved as I get more skillful.
